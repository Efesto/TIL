[Tips for retrospectives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-5AuMoWgxM)

### Must have
- Core team should be there
- Managers should not be there
- Good facilitator must know how to make people relax
- Review previous retrospectives action items before starting the new one

__The soup exercise__
  - Define a circle of things within team's control
  - Contained in a circle of things out of control but within understanding of the team
  - Everyhing else is the soup
  - Helps to build a culture of control, works with teams not used to being in control to fight back a "someone else's problem" kind of culture
  - > Some problems require coffee to be solved, some other requires wine to not care about
