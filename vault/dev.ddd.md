### Why should we do it?
- Definining an obiquitous domain model helps communication within all the part of an organization because of a common language and vocabulary
  - Increases productivity by reducing mistakes
  - Reduces the need for explaination
  - Helps keep a vision of the state of the system
 
### How to do it?
- Define a glossary
  - Complete with nouns and verbs
- Sketch a relational graph
  - UML works
- Bind the model to the implementation
- Brainstorm and experiment
