Pair programming is difficult, is about showing your fears, your weaknesses and in the meantime develop the discipline for keeping the focus.
Cannot come out of nothing, must be trained, like a muscle and continuously, like a habit.

> A fear that pairing is too hard, that people wouldn’t choose to do it if they weren’t corralled into it by peer pressure and equipment affordances. That a “pairing culture” is such a delicate wisp of a thing that if you allowed engineers individual workstations, they would abandon it immediately.

### Must do
- Time boxing with breaks
- Define time for pairing
- Focus
- If someone is more introvert, leave time for itself
- Keep talking: if you don't know, ask, if you know, explain

### For remote
- Show your face
- Switch host side

**Doesn't work**
- Organize free for all sessions
  - Nobody will skip them and too many people will be present
