Take down nightmarish monsters, as you compete for the bounties that will bring you glory, gear, and gold in this unforgiving – and unforgettable - online multiplayer experience.\n\n> Lousiana, 1895.\nTrent’anni sono passati dalla grande Guerra Civile che ha insanguinato gli Stati Uniti. Un tempo terribile dove fratelli hanno sparso il sangue di altri fratelli, i padri quello dei figli e i figli quello dei genitori. L’orrore è stato molto, la sofferenza insostenibile.\nLa terra deve ancora riprendersi da tanta devastazione e un nuovo, tremendo flagello la sta colpendo.\nLa Piaga è arrivata.\nI morti tornano in vita, abomini blasfemi calcano le strade del bayou, le paludi salmastre della costa, seminando morte, distruzione e malattia. La natura stessa sembra trasformarsi in una grottesca e folle imitazione della vita. Gli abitanti dei villaggi, delle fattorie e dei porti sono costretti a difendersi come possono o fuggono abbandonando le loro case.\nPochi restano a combattere.\nTanti muoiono travolti dalle creature demoniache.\nTroppi perdono il lume della ragione e si smarriscono nell’oscurità delle loro menti.\nE allora comparvero i Cacciatori.\nVenuta a conoscenza della situazione, la American Hunters Association ha inviato i suoi Cacciatori, mercenari maledetti dal dono della Vista Oscura, assassini ed eroi il cui compito è tracciare, inseguire, abbattere e bandire agli Inferi le mostruosità fuggite dai gironi infernali che ora scavano la loro strada nella carne e nel sangue della Louisiana. Grazie al loro potere, i Cacciatori possono vedere le tracce del Male, possono sentire i sussurri velenosi della follia e con fuoco, proiettili, lame e incrollabile volontà possono schiacciare le grottesche creature che li generano.\nQualcuno arriva nel bayou per purificare la terra dal Male.\nQualcuno per inseguire la gloria.\nQualcun altro in cerca di denaro e bottino.\nAltri per redimersi dal crimini del loro passato.\nAltri ancora per perpetrare la loro oscura vendetta.\nMa tutti sono qui per una cosa e una cosa soltanto.\nLa Caccia. -- Grampasso\n\n### For beginners\n![](/brain/assets/images/2021-04-17-18-59-56.png)\n\n- [100 Tips and Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxQ4U13e3XQ)\n- [50 more tips and tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGLhehF85U8)\n- [Good habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB82ucBEQ0M)\n- [Things that get you killed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgEJF1IvGS0)\n\n### Youtubers to follow\n- [Psychoghost](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC36zqNurlo4asfw1fp1N0LA)\n- [4FS Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkbFDtDfnPmZEdgd1nhyKCQ)\n\n### Nice to have\n- [On hunt firearms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLE31drHO0Y)\n- [My gameplays playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZIdQuKML5p_6QyxSYTyEIbuDR8rtl9AA)\n- [Grampasso's playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP6vFeahgVQMV4iw3WAlG0TGQ-tTCPHJy)\n- [Soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3vfSIBYEThPQXe3LXityGk)\n\n## How to deal with\n### Immolators\n- Good for spotting enemy hunters\n- After punched, they die after some time\n\nYes: \n- Poison ammo (one shot)\n- Blunt attacks\n- Choke bombs\n\nNope:\n- Stabbing and slicing attacks\n- Shooting\n- Fire (duh)\n\n### Hounds\n- Clean the area of them before start shooting, these fuckers bite\n- Start to be a challenge to be killed alone when more than 3\n\nYes: \n- Stabbing with knife by charging them\n- Punching on the face (one shot)\n- Headshots with nagant silenced\n- Firebombs (for quickly cleaning an area and blocking their attack way)\n\n\n### FAQ\n- Are the DLCs adding something \"something\"?\n  - The DLCs are only for skins, they don't actually add anything to the gameplay\n\n- How many players per match?\n  - Each game contains max 12 players, divided in trios, duos or solos\n \n- Is there crossplay?\n  - Only between Xbox and PS4/5\n\n\n### Quickplay\n> The best way to learn how to shoot people and not caring about money\n\n- 12 players per server\n- Everyone against everyone\n- Random starting weapon, but you can choose between 4 categories\n- Around the map you'll find weapons and equipment\n- Goal: survive the countdown by being the wellspring at the end\n- For becoming the wellsprint you need to close the rifts and being the first to close the last OR kill the wellspring\n- If you survive, the hunter, his equipment and traits will be available for recruiting in the lobby\n- Everytime a rift is closed a random trait is assigned to the hunter\n- Everytime the wellspring is killed or kills another player, some seconds are reduced from the countdown\n- When a player closes 4 rifts and becomes the wellspring, all the other rifts will be disabled\n- When a player is the wellspring is visible to everyone (similarly to the bounty carrier) but additionally will be visible as an orange shadow in darksight\n- Experience with weapons is kept even if the hunter doesn't survive","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/c7949240-de85-4915-a47d-bf37c97354b6.html","relUrl":"notes/c7949240-de85-4915-a47d-bf37c97354b6.html"},{"doc":"Neat Tricks","title":"Neat Tricks","hpath":"videogames.hunt_showdown.neat_tricks","content":"### Hiding traps\n![](/brain/assets/images/2021-07-16-10-27-14.png)\n","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/I4IEqToEMH125axa.html","relUrl":"notes/I4IEqToEMH125axa.html"},{"doc":"People","title":"People","hpath":"people","content":"\n[Change your organization diary](https://proxy.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ChangeYourOrganizationDiary)\n\n> You can ChangeYourOrganization (change how the work is done at your current employer) or ChangeYourOrganization.

Stability, Confidence, consistency and repeatability\n  * Single automated path from commit to deploy\n  * As a collaboration point\n  * As a visible visualization of path to production\n* __Enabler Team__\n  * Build useful shared devop tools\n  * Develop culture by example\n  * Bring and transfer technical knowledge\n    * EG: building the first pipeline\n  *  ![some enabler team models](/brain/assets/images/confs.gotopia_2020.2.png)\n  * Enabler team typical dissolve\n* 4 eyes principle requires active partecipation of unlocking managers\n  * Part of the culture\n  * Part of the sustainability -

Time in process, percentages (as a meaning for estimation), identify the real goal, consider, fixed cost time (like commuting)\n* Normal distribution for estimation doesn't make sense, what makes sense is average time of things in processing time\n* Enabler team is a really cool concept for pushing devops\n\n","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/4ddc16fc-0bf8-42ee-b292-5214cee9ab0c.html","relUrl":"notes/4ddc16fc-0bf8-42ee-b292-5214cee9ab0c.html"},{"doc":"Cooking","title":"Cooking","hpath":"cooking","content":"\n","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/6ae93e6a-4745-413d-ac62-a1479d4a1850.html","relUrl":"notes/6ae93e6a-4745-413d-ac62-a1479d4a1850.html"},{"doc":"Recipes","title":"Recipes","hpath":"cooking.recipes","content":"","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/18725d6a-b7fc-45dc-a079-60df3b7ca23b.html","relUrl":"notes/18725d6a-b7fc-45dc-a079-60df3b7ca23b.html"},{"doc":"Pancakes","title":"Pancakes","hpath":"cooking.recipes.pancakes","content":"\n## Easy Peasy pancakes\n\n* 1 mug general purpose flour\n* 1 mug milk\n* 1 egg\n* 1 teaspoon baking soda\n* 1 table spoon sugar\n* flavouring (optional)\n","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/0d4b427f-a389-4ee1-b910-f62aae333956.html","relUrl":"notes/0d4b427f-a389-4ee1-b910-f62aae333956.html"},{"doc":"How to potato","title":"How to potato","hpath":"cooking.recipes.how_to_potato","content":"\n## The potato lasagna\n\n### Ingredients\n- 5/6 medium sized potatoes\n- [[cooking.recipes.bechamel]] with 50 gr or more of flour as base\n- Butter\n- Cheese\n- Whatever else\n\n### Preparation\n- Peel and cut some potatoes in big slices (around 5/6 medium sized)\n- Boil the slices for 5 minutes in salted water\n- Turn on the oven at around 180 degrees\n- Butter a casserole\n- Prepare [[cooking.recipes.bechamel]]\n- Make a layer of potatoes over the butter and add the bechamel plus whatever your heart desires\n- continue until end\n- cover the top with some sweet, sweet cheese\n- oven it for 40 minutes circa or until\n\n","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/43b36e0c-16e7-48db-a457-2bdbee043577.html","relUrl":"notes/43b36e0c-16e7-48db-a457-2bdbee043577.html"},{"doc":"Chicken","title":"Chicken","hpath":"cooking.recipes.chicken","content":"\n## Marinated Chicken\n- 2 Tbs balsamic vinegard\n- 2 Tbs Extravirgin olive oil\n- Cumin\n- Paprika\n- Cajenne pepper\n- Salt\n- 2 chicken legs and one chest\n\nMarinate 5 hours and bake in the oven\n\n### Prepared on 2.5.2021\n- Add a bit more salt\n- The chicken was really moisty but the taste was pretty acidic\n- Try with less vinegard","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/79a7e435-09d6-4972-b566-7bea856b54c6.html","relUrl":"notes/79a7e435-09d6-4972-b566-7bea856b54c6.html"},{"doc":"Bechamel","title":"Bechamel","hpath":"cooking.recipes.bechamel","content":"\n### Ingredients\n- Flour\n- Butter\n- Milk\n\nFlour and butter must be in the same quantity\n\n### Preparation\n- Melt the butter in a pot\n- Mix butter and flour\n- Low the fire and add milk\n- Mix until smooth\n- Keep adding milk until the desired consistency is reached\n\n### Sources\n- [Cucchiaio d'argento](https://www.cucchiaio.it/ricetta/ricetta-besciamella/)\n\n","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/8c58e3ae-d67a-4790-947d-1cb4dd3f23ad.html","relUrl":"notes/8c58e3ae-d67a-4790-947d-1cb4dd3f23ad.html"},{"doc":"Construction","title":"Construction","hpath":"construction","content":"\n","url":"https://www.marcopolita.me/brain/notes/7ba4c954-890f-4605-9ff4-651728930e25.html","relUrl":"notes/7ba4c954-890f-4605-9ff4-651728930e25.html"},{"doc":"Tiling","title":"Tiling","hpath":"construction.tiling","content":"\n## Things to consider before starting\n- Tiles positioning\n- Tiles direction\n- Grout color\n- Profiles style for corners and frames\n- How straight are the walls and eventually problematic parts\n- Positions of pipes, bathroom appliances\n- What's the surface on which the tiles will lay for deciding how to support the screws\n\n## Necessary tools & material\n- Boring driller\n  -
